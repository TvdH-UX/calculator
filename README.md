# calculator

In this project I will demonstrate my HTML & CSS abilities through
creating a visual interface for a calculator.

Additionaly, I will demonstrate my Javascript skills through writing
functions with which a user can do calculations on (multiple) numbers.
These functions will be built using the various methods learned, possibly 
including methods such as reduce and map.
